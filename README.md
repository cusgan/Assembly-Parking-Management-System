# Parking Management System

An assembly language program designed to manage parking slots within the CIT-U campus efficiently. The system tracks available slots, assigns them to vehicles, and marks them as occupied upon entry. It features functionalities for displaying current slot availability, releasing slots upon vehicle exit, and handling basic error conditions like full capacity.
